## This is the source code for my portfolio site

### The whole site was built with only HTML and CSS 
and no JS whatsoever.

- Uses CSS animations to make the site look more tolerable 
- Uses the newly added <code>scroll()</code> function in css to match the animations with the scrolling rate of the user without JS.
- Uses Google Fonts and many other CDNs
- makes a request to an API straight up in HTML to submit the contact me form

### Any improvements I would add
- make a hamburger menu for mobile devices.
- change up the colour scheme
- position the footer in the bottom without gaps 
- made the hover popups more aesthetic instead of the current half and half solution.
