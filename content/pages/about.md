I'm Varun R Mallya, a UG student at IIT Roorkee.  
I work on a variety of things, but you’ll usually find me messing around with programs written in C, C++, or Rust.

I contribute to [_sysprof_](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/sysprof) as part of my GSoC project, where I’m currently working on adding `zsh` support to [_bpftool_](https://github.com/libbpf/bpftool). I also contribute to GCC-Rust, Reth, and Wasmedge.

You can find my work on [_GitHub_](https://github.com/varun-r-mallya) and [GNOME's GitLab\*](https://gitlab.gnome.org/varunrmallya).

Outside of programming, I enjoy working on hardware projects and exploring security topics. Occasionally, I also attempt to solve complex Mechanical Engineering problems (usually during exams).

I'm a developer at [_SDSLabs_](https://sdslabs.co), where I build new tools and maintain old ones.

I sometimes dabble in CTFs, mostly focusing on reverse engineering (though I’m still learning).  
Oh, and I read a lot of manga.
