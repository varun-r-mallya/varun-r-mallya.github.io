I'm Varun R Mallya, a UG student at IIT Roorkee.  
I work on a variety of things, but you’ll usually find me messing around with BPF in the Linux Kernel.

I am an original author of [PythonBPF](https://github.com/PythonBPF/Python-BPF) and I have spoken at the Linux Plumbers Conference in Tokyo in 2025 and am scheduled to speak at FOSDEM 2026 happening in Brussels regarding PythonBPF as well.
Apart from this, I have begun to hack on the kernel--specifically on eBPF and related tools.

I contributed to [_sysprof_](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/sysprof) as part of my GSoC project. I have also contributed to Libp2p and was a part of the Protocol Labs Dev guild for two continuous cohorts.
I've won various hackathons spanning web3, security, AI and so on.
You can find my work on [_GitHub_](https://github.com/varun-r-mallya) and [GNOME's GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/varunrmallya).  
I'm a member of [_SDSLabs_](https://sdslabs.co), where I hang out with my friends.
